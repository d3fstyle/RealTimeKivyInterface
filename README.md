# RealTime UDP Kivy Interface #

UI made in Kivy to represent real time telemetry from remote host. Project abandoned and uncomplete but maybe someone encounters it interesting as tutorial to start something with Kivy.

- Coded in Python 2.7.X, but I don't think there were any problems changing to Python 3.
- Responsive window. UI icons were created within a font for ease.
- There is one column of the interface that can alternate between two measures when its icon is clicked.
- Menu screen not implemented. Icon in main view animated.
- spec file used to make a Windows executable.
